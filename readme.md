## EDA

### Is this a good market for flipping homes?

Since less than 1% of the properties have multiple sale dates and renovations in the last 20 years is below 2%, flipping houses in this market is likely difficult. However, if a property does have a logged renovation year, there is an average 34.74% sales price lift

### How does the time of year impact sale prices?

The average quarterly sale price hovers year round at around $446K. There is no significant price change in any specific quarter. It's interesting to note that from the provided dataset, houses sold in Q2 saw a 5.76% sales price lift.

### How do waterfront locations and quality of the view affect sale prices?

Yes, the trend here shows that waterfront properties on average are selling at 211% higher than properties without a waterfront record in the dataset. The category of view, from ranking 0-4 with zero as nonexistent and 4 being the best view, is directly correlated with prices: higher view rank = higher selling price.
